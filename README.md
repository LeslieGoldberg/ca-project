Description of problem : Curriculum Associates Professional Learning Development Specialists give a professional development session (PD) in which teachers in grades K-8 who are new to using the i-Ready Math resource take an i-Ready Math diagnostic test using a student username from the grade they teach. PD Specialists need an easy way to distribute these usernames virtually during virtual PD in such a way that the teachers do not have access to those usernames after the session.

PD Specialist - the person running the PD
PD - refers to this specific session that needs this solution
Participant - a teacher taking the PD
Yield - will return the next item in a given list

User Journey:
Given I am a PD specialist, when I start a new PD, then I will post a link to a form that asks for participants’ Name and Grade they teach.
When a participant completes the form, a username matching the grade they teach will be added next to their name on the resulting spreadsheet.


From Kristen:
Step 1: Submit their name, grade level
Step 2: That information comes to PD Specialist, username is matched to that information for the PD Specialist
Step 3: Display the Name, Grade Level, Username 
Only PDS, display from my screen
OR
Public: link to a site that displays the current results 
Step 4: “Delete that information” 
If an educator returns to the display site after an hour, they won’t see their name or username
Username usability resets at midnight
